[![Rust](https://github.com/fpco/amber/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fpco/amber/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Manage secret values in-repo via public key cryptography. See [the announcement blog post](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/announcing-amber-ci-secret-tool/) for more motivation.

Amber provides the ability to securely store secret data in a plain-text file. Secrets can be encrypted by anyone with access to the file, without the ability to read those files without a secret key. The file format is a plain text YAML file which minimizes diffs on value changes, making it amenable to tracking changes in version control.

The primary use case for Amber is storing secret values for Continuous Integration systems. In most CI secrets management systems, there is no way to track the changes in values over time. With Amber, the public key and encrypted values live inside the repo, ensuring future runs of the same commit will either fail (if you've misplaced/changed the key) or have identical inputs.

## Install

See below for OS specific packages. Alternatively, you can install from source by [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and running `cargo install --git https://github.com/fpco/amber`. Binaries are available on the [release page](https://github.com/fpco/amber/releases). Place the executable on your `PATH` and ensure that the executable bit is set (for non-Windows platforms).

### Arch Linux

There is a [AUR package available for Amber](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/amber-secrets/). Install with `makepkg` or your preferred helper:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/amber-secrets.git
cd amber-secrets
makepkg -si
```

### Nix/NixOS

Amber is available as part of nixpkgs under the name `amber-secret`.

### GitHub actions

For installing and caching `amber`, in GitHub actions workflow you can
use [psibi/setup-amber](https://github.com/psibi/setup-amber).

Example usage:

``` yaml
- uses: psibi/setup-amber@v1.0
  with:
    amber-version: 'v0.1.3' # Optional version, otherwise latest
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The
[GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret)
secret is optional, but is recommended to avoid rate limiting. You
don't have to set up anything specific for it since for each workflow
run, GitHub automatically populates that token for you.

The [amber-demo](https://github.com/psibi/amber-demo) repository has an example workflow showcasing the
usage of this GitHub action.

## Usage

Running `amber --help` will give you full, up to date set of instructions. The `--amber-yaml` option, or the `AMBER_YAML` environment variable, can be used to specify the location of the file containing your secret values. If unspecified, it will default to `amber.yaml`. The typical workflow is:

* `amber init` to create a new secret key and `amber.yaml` file.
* Securely store that secret key, such as in a password manager. Additionally, if desired, put that secret key in your CI system's secrets.
* Add additional secrets with `amber encrypt`.
    * Use the "read from stdin" feature to encrypt whole files `amber encrypt SECRET_SAUCE < my-secret-sauce.txt`
* Commit your `amber.yaml` file into your repository.
* Within your CI scripts, or when using your secrets on your own system:
    * Set the `AMBER_SECRET` environment variable to your secret key.
    * Use `amber print` to see a list of your secrets.
    * Use `amber exec ...` to execute subcommands with the secrets available.
* Over time, use `amber encrypt` to add new secrets or update existing secrets, and `amber remove` to remove a secret entirely.
* By storing the secrets in Git, you'll always be able to recover old secret values.

Here's a sample shell session:

```shellsession
$ amber init
Your secret key is: 15aa07775395303732870cff2cc35c26f94af3344cf0f85d230aa004234d9764
Please save this key immediately! If you lose it, you will lose access to your secrets.
Recommendation: keep it in a password manager
If you're using this for CI, please update your CI configuration with a secret environment variable
export AMBER_SECRET=15aa07775395303732870cff2cc35c26f94af3344cf0f85d230aa004234d9764
$ amber encrypt PASSWORD deadbeef
$ amber print

## Authors

This tool was written by the [FP Complete](https://www.fpcomplete.com/) engineering team. It was originally part of a deployment system for our [Kube360 Kubernetes software collection](https://www.fpcomplete.com/products/kube360/). We decided to extract the generalizable parts to a standalone tool to improve Continuous Integration workflows.

If you have a use case outside of CI, or additional features you think would fit in well, please let us know in the issue tracker!
